File Manager project for CECS 343 Intro to Software Engineering, Spring 2020.

Dear Professor Ngo,
    Please be aware that we did not initially plan on using GitHub. I began pushing my code to it to get in the habit of doing so, and after that and the shift to online classes we decided to begin using it. Because of this, some code was integrated manually. I've made an effort to make sure that credit is given to the other members of my group for their code. I've used additional "@author" annotations in the JavaDocs comments in order to do this. It may not be bad practice for GitHub, but we've only been utilizing the master branch for simplicity. There are no additional branches.
